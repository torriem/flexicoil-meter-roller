A collection of CAD files pertaining to the Flexicoil 50 series and older air cart meter rollers.  An OpenSCAD library, called "Flexicoil Meter Segment.scad" creates various kinds of meter roller segments, for 3-D printing.  Currently implemented roller types are extra fine (canola), fine (wheat), coarse (fertlizer, peas), extra coarse (large peas etc), and blank, with a 1 1/8" hex hole through them.  Dimensions defining the diameter and width of the rollers, as well as printer tolerances for the hex hole, are in dimensions.scad.

demo.scad is a quick demo showing the five types of meter rollers, and various options for spiraling the flutes and adding divider portions.
